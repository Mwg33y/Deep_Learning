# Deep_Learning

Deep learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence that uses mathematical algorithms to process data with minimal 
human interference (supervised/unsupervised). The data is extracted from an observed system or set of circumstances. 
The elements that generate or create data in a system are the parameters of the system. Deep learning uses mathemitical 
algorithms. It also uses a set of processes and steps to model each parameters significance in the observed system. The result
is an algorithm model that imitates/mimics the system. This modeled can be used to make predictions and identify patterns 
in a system. A Deep Leaning algorithm is first trained with a portion of the data available from the system. It is then tested
using another portion of the same data to verify if the model represents the system. 

Between the input of data and the output of a representative model, Deep Learning algorithms use many steps to determine a 
model's behaviour. This steps form networks and process information similar to the way that neurons in the human brain do. This 
also means that Deep Learning requires significant computer processing power when creating a model using large amounts of 
data, and many intermittent steps.
